# CMU Custom Menu Option
#
# This file allows CMU users to add their own menu options to the CMU GUI.
# These custom menu options are displayed in the popup menu that appears
# after selecting one or more nodes from the left-side of the CMU GUI and
# right-clicking on the selection. 
#
# file format: one line per custom menu option
# line syntax: GUI|SERVER;<title>;<command>
# 2 semicolons per line are required!
#
#   first field: GUI       = execute the command from the CMU GUI
#   first field: SERVER    = execute the command from the CMU server
#  second field: <title>   = name of this option in the menu
#   third field: <command> = command line to be executed, including args
#
#
# In the <title> field, a '|' can be used to create a submenu. For example,
# to configure two webpages under one submenu called "Web":
# GUI;Web|CMU;"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" www.hp.com/go/cmu
# GUI;Web|HP ;"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" www.hp.com
# 
#
# In the <command> field, CMU will convert the following keywords to their
# respective values:
#     CMU_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  : IP address of the CMU management node
#     CMU_TEMP_NODE_FILE     : Temporary file containing the selected nodes,
#                              one nodename per line
#     CMU_ONE_NODE_SELECTED  : nodename of selected node. Note that if more
#                              than one node selected, this menu option will
#                              be disabled. This is useful for commands that
#                              are only designed to operate with one node.

# The following additional keywords will be converted for 'SERVER' commands:
#     CMU_GUI_IP_ADDRESS     : IP address of node running the CMU GUI
#     CMU_GUI_DISPLAY_NUMBER : Display number of the CMU GUI X-Server
#
#
# CMU recommends that these commands be simple scripts that do not produce
# a lot of output. CMU recommends that these commands be tested locally
# before configuring them in CMU.
#
# The CMU GUI must be restarted to incorporate any changes made to this file.
#

# Sample menu option 'Clear /tmp', that will use pdsh to
# delete the contents of /tmp on the selected nodes. Note
# that single quotes around the pdsh sub-command are needed
# to ensure that the wildcard '*' works on the target nodes
# and not on the CMU server node.
#SERVER;Clear /tmp;env WCOLL=CMU_TEMP_NODE_FILE /opt/cmu/bin/pdsh -S 'rm -rf /tmp/*'

# Sample menu option 'CMU Webpage' that will launch IE
# and display the CMU web page (this option assumes that
# the CMU GUI will be running on a Windows PC).
#GUI;CMU Webpage;"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" www.hp.com/go/cmu

# Sample menu option 'colplot' that will launch IE and
# display colplot served from the CMU management node
# (this options assumes that the CMU GUI will be running
# on a Windows PC, and that colplot has been configured
# on the CMU management node; see the CMU Users Guide
# for details).
#GUI;colplot;"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" CMU_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS/colplot

# Sample menu options in an 'audit' submenu that execute
# system inventory commands and compare the output from
# the selected nodes using the new cmu_diff feature in
# the cmu_dsh command.
#SERVER;audit|dmidecode;/opt/cmu/bin/cmu_dsh -f CMU_TEMP_NODE_FILE -c "dmidecode" -e "-b -n -v0 -R0"
#SERVER;audit|lspci;/opt/cmu/bin/cmu_dsh -f CMU_TEMP_NODE_FILE -c "lspci" -e "-b -n -v0 -R0"
